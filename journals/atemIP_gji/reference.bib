abstract ={We inverted airborne time-domain electromagnetic (ATEM) data over a porphyry deposit in central British Columbia, Canada and recovered the 3D electrical conductivity structure. Full 3D inversion was required because of the circular geometry of the deposit. Typical analysis, which assumes a homogeneous or layered earth, produces conductive artifacts that are contrary to geologic expectations. A synthetic example showed that those misleading artifacts arise by assuming a 1D layered earth and that a 3D inversion can successfully solve the problem. Because of the computational challenges of solving the 3D inversion with many transmitters of airborne survey, we introduced a work flow that uses a multimesh strategy to handle the field data. In our inversion, a coarse mesh and a small number of soundings are first used to rapidly reconstruct a large-scale distribution of conductivity. The mesh is then refined and more soundings are incorporated to better resolve small-scale features. This strategy significantly speeds up the 3D inversion. The progressive refinement of the mesh also helps find the resolution limit of the data and an appropriate mesh for inversion, thus overcomputing on an unnecessarily fine mesh can be avoided. The final conductivity structure has features that emulate the expected geologic structure for a porphyry system and this substantiates the need and capability for working in 3D. However, the necessity for using 3D can depend upon the EM system used. A previous 1D interpretation of frequency-domain EM data at Mt. Milligan indicated a resistive stock. We reconciled this result with the present by computing the footprints of the frequency and time-domain surveys. The distribution of currents for the frequency-domain system was smaller than the length scale of the geologic target while the opposite was true for the time-domain data.},

@article{Chen2003,
abstract = {The magnetic induced polarization (MIP) method is an exploration technique used to obtain information relating to the induced polarization characteristics of the subsurface through measurements of the primary magnetic field associated with steady-state current flow in the earth. According to Seigel, the secondary magnetic field due to polarization current can be expressed as a sum of the products of chargeability and the derivative of primary magnetic field, due to ohmic current, with respect to the logarithmic conductivity (or sensitivity). The magnetic field and the sensitivity matrix can be computed by subsequently solving Poisson's equation and a magnetostatic problem in terms of potentials using a finite-volume algorithm. The MIP response is a function of chargeability difference (?-?0) and relative conductivity (s/s0), where h0 and s0 are constants. When solving the inverse problem we need to impose positivity of the solution but the fact that MIP responses depend only upon the difference in chargeability means we have options regarding how we set up the inversion. We can: (1) invert for ? without constraints and add a constant to the final result, (2) invert for ? while imposing positivity, or (3) work with ln ?. We compare all three methods here. Our inversion problem is formulated as an optimization problem where the objective function of the model is minimized subject to the constraints that the model adequately reproduces the data. We use a Gauss-Newton method to obtain the model perturbation at each iteration. The system of equations is solved using a conjugate gradient least squares method. In order to make the inversion produce depth or distance information, a depth weighting or sensitivity-based weighting is required. Through synthetic model studies, we have shown that the conductivity ratio between a target and its host has a large effect on the MIP response. Ratios greater than two orders of magnitude difference will eventually make the MIP response undetectable. However, if the ratio is in the range of 0.1 to 10, the effect on the recovered chargeability is limited. The inversion algorithm is demonstrated by inverting the data set from Binduli, Australia.},

abstract = {We propose a methodology to generate a 3D distribution of pseudo-chargeability from airborne time domain electromagnetic data. The processing flow is as follows: (a) Apply 3D inversion to TEM data to restore a background conductivity. This might involve omitting responses that are obviously contaminated with IP signals, such as negative transients in coincident loop surveys. The recovered background conductivity is assumed to be uncontaminated by IP signals. (b) Compute the TEM response from the background conductivity and subtract it from the observations. This yields the dIP data, and reduces the EM coupling. (c) The background conductivity is likely not exactly the earth conductivity, but we assume that the major effects of this inaccuracy will lead to a large scale, smoothly varying perturbation to the dIP data. If this correct, then these can be recognized and removed. (d) The final data are linearly related to a pseudo-chargeability through a sensitivity function that is analogous to that employed in usual DC-IP ground surveys. (e) The dIP data at various time channels can be inverted individually. The pseudo-chargeability models may be useful in themselves or they may be further processed to estimate Cole-Cole, or equivalent, parameters. We demonstrate our procedure on a field data set from Mt. Milligan. In the field example, we identify chargeable targets that show no indication of negative transients in the raw data. From the images we can make inferences about the relative strength and geometries of the chargeable bodies.},

abstract = {In this study, we revisit three airborne EM surveys over Tli Kwi Cho (TKC). These consist of a frequency domain DIGHEM data set, and two time domain surveys, VTEM and AeroTEM. Negative transients have been recorded in both of the time domain surveys and we interpret these as arising from chargeable bodies. The kimberlite pipes are referred to as DO-27 and DO-18. We look in more detail at the transient data and apply the ATEM-IP inversion procedure to recover a 3D pseudo-chargeability distribution. Important components of the analysis involve estimating a background conductivity for the region. For DO-27 we have used a 3D parametric inversion to recover the conductivity from TEM data. The IP signal for the inversion is obtained by subtracting the time domain responses estimated by EM inversion from the observed background signal. This process also removes EM coupling noise that might be contaminating the data. The resultant IP data are inverted with a linear inverse approach using the sensitivity from the background conductivity. This yields a 3D model of pseudo-chargeability.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide injection monitoring in offshore environments is a promising future application of the marine controlled-source electromagnetic (mCSEM) method. To investigate whether the mCSEM method can be used to quantitatively monitor variations in the distribution of the injected CO2, we developed a mCSEM inversion scheme and conducted numerical analyses. Furthermore, to demonstrate the monitoring capability of the mCSEM method in challenging environments, we used a deep brine aquifer model in shallow sea as an injection target. The mCSEM responses of the injected CO2 in the deep brine aquifer were severely decayed and heavily masked by the air wave due to the proximity of the free space. Therefore, the accurate computation of small mCSEM responses due to the injected CO2 and the proper incorporation into the inversion process are critically important for the mCSEM method to be successful. Additionally, in monitoring situations, some useful a priori information is usually available (e.g. well logs and seismic sections), and the proper implementation of this to our inversion framework is crucial to ensure reliable estimation of the distribution of the injected CO2 plume. In this study, we developed an efficient 2.5D mCSEM inversion algorithm based on an accurate forward modelling algorithm and the judicious incorporation of a priori information into our inversion scheme. The inversion scheme was tested with simplified and realistic CO2 injection models and successfully recovered the resistivity distributions of the injected CO2, although it still required the presence of a considerable amount of the injected CO2. Based on these inversion experiments, we demonstrated that the mCSEM method is capable of quantitatively monitoring variations in the distribution of injected CO2 in offshore environments. },
